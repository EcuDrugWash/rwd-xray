From @twizzter:
I've analysed few dumps and i believe i found some dependency:

Let's assume filename is ABCDE-FGH-IJKL, then ID inside would be something like:
AABBCCDEED--FFG[always C]H[always A]--I[always A]J[always 0]KL[always 00]

Second thing: if filename in named like smth-smth-smth_H710_H720_H730, only last H730 is taken and coded inside dump.

Don't know if this "algo" will work with files other than 37805 (ECUs).
Anyway, we could simply look for "3377880550" for now.
